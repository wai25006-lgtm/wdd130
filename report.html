        <h1>Client Report</h1>
        <h4>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h4>
        <p>I didn't really have any ideas for what I wanted my website to be about, but a cooking webiste sounded fun, so I decided to use some recipies that I have. As for images, I just used images to give an example to the user of what they would be making.</p>

        <h4>How did you communicate with your developer? Were there any issues with communication?</h4>
        <p>I tried to communicate with my developer on email and text, but she never responded. I was able to reach out to the junior developers on Microsoft teams though.</p>

        <h4>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h4>
        <p>The lead developer never actually made her page. The junior developers did good though.</p>
        
        <h4>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h4>
        <p>I will try to communicate more often with my team. I want to make sure that we keep communicating.</p>

        <h1>Lead Developer Report</h1>
        <h4>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks to your junior devs?</h4>
        <p>I tried to lay out what pages my junior developers needed to do, and I gave them the site plan too. We used Microsoft teams to communicate.</p>
    
        <h4>How did you communicate with your client? Were there any issues?</h4>
        <p>To communicate with my client we texted and emailed.</p>

        <h4>How did you handle publishing your client's site and sharing it with the client?</h4>
        <p>I made the css, and my junior developers sent me theirs so that I could add it on to the bottom. I invited the client to the GitHub Repository so that he would have the link. </p>
    
        <h4>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h4>
        <p>It was kind of confusing at first, because GitHub is hard to learn, but after you get into the rythm, it was kind of nice.</p>

        <h1>Junior Developer Report for Croix Jonson's Page</h1>
        <h4>How did you communicate with your team lead? Were there any issues?</h4>
        <p>We communicated on Microsoft Teams. There weren't any communication issues.</p>

        <h4>Did you know what was expected of you for this site?</h4>
        <p>I did know what was expected of me. I was asked to make the services page for this website.</p>

        <h4>Were you able to contribute to this site?</h4>
        <p>I was! I made the services page, and it matches the others really well. I think that this website ended up looking the best and most professional out of all of them. Our CSS looks really good.</p>

        <h4>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the site?</h4>
        <p>Not too many. I think one of the files I uploaded had the same name so I had to change it, but other than that it was all good.</p>

        <h1>Junior Developer Report for Ira Chelsey's Page</h1>
        <h4>How did you communicate with your team lead? Were there any issues?</h4>
        <p>I texted my team lead. However, I will say, I didn't get invited to the GitHub Repository till the second week.</p>

        <h4>Did you know what was expected of you for this site?</h4>
        <p>Kind of. I was told which page I would make, but it was really hard for me to find the wireframe, it wasn't anywhere on the GitHub.</p>

        <h4>Were you able to contribute to this site?</h4>
        <p>Since I didn't find the wireframe until later, I did add the delivery page to the website.</p>

        <h4>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the site?</h4>
        <p>Not really. I just had to connect the folder to the repository.</p>

        <h1>General Experience and Reflection</h1>
        <h4>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h4>
        <p>The most challenging part was probably the CSS. It was hard to make it look like your teammates. I could have done better, but I got it done.</p>

        <h4>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h4>
        <p>I specifically liked working on Croix Jonson's website. It looks really good, and the team I worked with was pretty cool.</p>

        <h4>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h4>
        <p>Even though I hate talking to new people, I would try and communicate better with everyone.</p>

        <h4>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h4>
        <p>I do feel a little more confident, but I feel like I need to do it a lot more. I want to do something similar so that I can be a better team member so that the final product is better.</p>
